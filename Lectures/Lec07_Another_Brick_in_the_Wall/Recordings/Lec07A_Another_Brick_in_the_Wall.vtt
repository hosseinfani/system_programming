00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.260
but the idea is that, uh.

NOTE Confidence: 0.627112046153846

75880a8e-dbcb-4a18-b2dc-33f79c577812
00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.380
Are we as a computer scientist?

845fe9bf-91e4-421d-aaa8-ef2be57cd266
00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.036
We are going to build robots or algorithm

act like human but not the reverse.

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.098
So we are not going to ask you

NOTE Confidence: 0.627112046153846

61bca476-96f1-4136-9d31-4515671d9b13
00:05:14.098 --> 00:05:16.310
to act like a robot,

db05f97f-9440-488c-bd4e-9a50262975fc
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.908
so you're probably most of you.

NOTE Confidence: 0.627112046153846

097eedf8-3f4c-4852-8194-c3e0fc2aac14
00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.758
I mean watch this brilliant video clip from

a977bfaa-b45c-4ec3-a398-6a8ccf4b3f7f
00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:29.476
So there's a huge difference between the

be37d654-0fa0-4336-af72-7d9a552dd746
00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.938
high school or I mean primary school.

NOTE Confidence: 0.627112046153846

a48f64c2-97a5-45fb-a647-1869b8dc89ce
00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:33.720
And the,

1bf5c869-fea1-4430-8323-4cfe35f5179c
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:34.110
uh,

NOTE Confidence: 0.627112046153846

4fa390c3-3550-4be6-b216-0db1ccf6550d
00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.840
I mean secondary school or the universities.

e5c2abbc-f774-4791-993f-873cca5bac8d
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.366
So basically here the main intention

NOTE Confidence: 0.627112046153846

61125854-e1a5-4add-9e31-e3590285d217
00:05:39.366 --> 00:05:42.127
is that to promote or motivate

54e37fa9-e8ae-4d9e-8941-f35cae507a07
00:05:42.127 --> 00:05:44.119
your own critical thinking.

ddfe9763-7c8c-4fe0-a6c0-6536b192fc54
00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.339
So the idea is that we shouldn't

NOTE Confidence: 0.627112046153846

be5c8860-0e2a-498b-8433-7cb1bb2dd6df
00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:48.614
just sit and receive the information

1dbf4be0-97b1-40c8-b642-7ca6e2ea0ffc
00:05:48.614 --> 00:05:51.526
and memorize it and pass the exams.

NOTE Confidence: 0.627112046153846

790d925e-d72d-4099-8895-31f68a61b10e
00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:54.248
We have to develop your own

cbe77d68-8f2e-4c47-852c-b5f84103f469

critical thinking.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.160
So this is another way to,

d0a4b179-8e2d-4745-9655-7e8a3b55a212
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.688
uh, explain this, uh?

0752fd44-0a0d-4463-bb48-ff5f43dbbcd1
00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.662
As a computer scientist,

c214d776-9d25-4e99-9a6f-d196e573f81f
00:06:03.662 --> 00:06:05.147
you can, uh,

00:06:07.632 --> 00:06:10.220
in terms of the knee,

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.104
but totally different in terms of the

You can be a person that who builds

a company like Google or Facebook,

511cc5d2-75ec-4bd3-a04a-ed58e2f2ae24

dd97459d-fae0-495a-ad8e-7cf2a6dc1a0a

So these are different levels of,

uh, you can pick one of them,

05a4f6ce-fc09-4e07-8183-cf435afaa793
00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.424
but the main idea,

NOTE Confidence: 0.627112046153846

6beae4c8-6931-4ee0-94d6-7a7a43947496
00:06:35.424 --> 00:06:36.276
I mean,

db0ccf2c-fd28-4cd7-ae07-a2ebdad9ead8
00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.962
my teaching style is that you

2ef6fd30-4a82-4ef4-9d40-687abb9a0350
00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:50.800
So I'm not going to teach in a way that

35e7a955-aba3-4017-8f8c-94fc56069b3a

So that's the reason that if you think

70083cde-6463-4bda-a519-e3b7ecb0ce72
00:23:17.385 --> 00:23:20.840

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:26.900
we can open a file or device,

00:24:08.566 --> 00:24:12.630

06daccaf-07d0-4522-9109-efeb794ae89a
00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:14.680

00:25:15.112 --> 00:25:17.666
you have the file descriptor so remember

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:24.535
just to show that you're

00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:34.406
So assuming you open an existing

c17c2c7b-e425-4d68-b173-e85a2ddfaafc
00:25:37.092 --> 00:25:39.759
then you read this amount of bytes.

6c8b9cbc-effa-4556-91c2-2a9f3a8486cc
00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:45.978
Meaning that you read a 11 bytes and

c3b5ad34-9e7a-4e8d-b875-88dd86a7a993

now the current offset because it left.

cabd017b-65f5-4565-b2ae-645ff99aab4c
00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:51.445
If you read another one, it becomes 12.

bab19e47-00f4-4a1c-b8cb-5ae82493ab4f
00:25:51.445 --> 00:25:53.170
If you write another bite,

ae593238-6b42-4ff1-abf4-9efd7aa1c317
00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:57.574

00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:01.094

d65fedcf-48e0-4104-b73e-3f05dfdffd81

bef0e14d-f86c-4e8f-aed2-24fea2f6e120

b85f3ae9-4f63-43ad-bbfd-c4d3df8972f4
00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:30.028

ee87e803-fbf5-4ca1-b66b-5e20ac217562
00:33:33.833 --> 00:33:36.961
or we just do not move the current

suddenly by mistake or whatever?

c3ddbf7e-09ac-48ce-b976-586ebacf1e89
00:34:21.490 --> 00:34:24.510
We changed the current offset

00:39:31.432 --> 00:39:35.820
So when you have a sorted information and

7f821887-503a-4b80-a26f-876e368761a1
00:46:20.230 --> 00:46:23.064
it just in next few slides when

74216f25-65ee-4028-8e44-e130a141d5a2
00:46:23.064 --> 00:46:26.028
you ask the kernel to returning

c95fbed8-5606-4adc-b7ba-9f033e42099b
00:46:26.028 --> 00:46:28.596

00:46:28.596 --> 00:46:31.140
I mean by doing the open system code

101afb4d-8a8e-4f89-9a80-adcd927f0f6d
00:46:31.214 --> 00:46:33.755
or by doing the create system fault.

b7421ca7-ce98-4cc1-822a-4c956193cf52
00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:36.124
So the FT which is returned

NOTE Confidence: 0.80049991

4d75a152-75fc-41ad-92d0-8d711ee1f26c
00:46:36.124 --> 00:46:37.700
by the system call.

5548818c-e0fa-40cd-93fc-3589a198043a
00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:41.060
At that moment, the kernel credit table

4d307255-3421-4672-981a-c9ecb767feae
00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:44.101
or information that keep tracks of

1a9a81aa-8fc2-4b62-b8b2-63384a3ee1e7
00:46:44.101 --> 00:46:47.137
anything related to that file descriptor.

00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:50.484
One of the information is the correct offset,

bbb9125a-cdb5-42b8-9c0f-577b0a98d0dc
00:46:50.490 --> 00:46:54.746
so the kernel have that has that value.

f5970c97-9c51-4e99-b837-2f613ea318b4
00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:56.661
And whenever you do another system called

f8a9358a-d4f2-4e2c-a0dd-d7df93e02e93
00:46:56.661 --> 00:46:58.488
read or another system called right,

7d48a6a3-b739-4a11-b227-18786b8fdd55
00:46:58.490 --> 00:47:00.758
they cannot change the value of that.

5d480328-0220-4eac-9291-5bcefb65be5c
00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:03.360
Just about it's variable.

00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:05.670
Uh, so initially it is zero,

00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:07.966
so when a by reading you have to

d73203f8-1eac-42b4-88c7-424972a1b72d
00:47:07.966 --> 00:47:09.851
pass the number of files that

7bc037a2-be6f-4be6-91fd-757acdc3aebc
00:47:09.851 --> 00:47:12.270
you want to read by the buffer.

8a49db9e-9552-4650-80fa-c1f64e70ad7a
00:47:12.270 --> 00:47:15.326
So when the kernel does the actual reading,

NOTE Confidence: 0.80049991

e83d57b1-d3a5-4112-8879-7309d5cec3c7
00:47:15.330 --> 00:47:17.619
it knows how many bytes is red.

a8525960-fbde-4ec0-a6ad-abb665e5538f
00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:21.769
So it added that value to the current offset.

f0e8146f-380f-4062-9d5d-9702600689dd
00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:24.242
So just a variable in the inside the

00:48:12.830 --> 00:48:15.070
So the idea is this,

f0c07a88-33ec-4b4f-bb82-f747206dcb5b
00:48:15.070 --> 00:48:17.373
