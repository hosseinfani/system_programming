00:11:43.262 --> 00:11:46.076
I mean after a while they store

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:54.344
so the opcodes becomes string of bytes.

0bcbbf25-5afa-4c46-8dac-5c0926bf9bc1
00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:58.578

00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:22.216
the assumption is that the file

00:53:24.432 --> 00:53:29.364
So then it only can open an existing file so.

e4e98027-1b58-45a7-9a6d-ee5931bff33e
00:53:29.364 --> 00:53:31.860
The answer is yes.

So how can we do that?

f1ebe5e5-d60c-47e9-8636-a76d2ac1bffd
00:53:44.970 --> 00:53:46.776
We have to first create the file.

0fb6ccc2-e6c8-4d2b-850c-2fb60fe7771d
00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:50.756
So using the create system call,

00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:52.860
