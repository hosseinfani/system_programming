00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.340
OK, so the theme of this chapter is

NOTE Confidence: 0.641548852142857

4e36cf8f-a6e6-4093-a18d-e4601e88592c
00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.107
borrowed from this movie The matrix

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.286
and the idea is that from this scene,

NOTE Confidence: 0.641548852142857

a0f423a4-24f0-4ce1-8393-52b2a0edac46
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.608
I mean, if you see the movie.

5cea15c8-d052-414d-be64-7c974593f6da
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.346
Uh, in the first few amount of the scenes

NOTE Confidence: 0.641548852142857

e04a4062-4bf7-4d5f-a210-292102b158ac
00:00:23.346 --> 00:00:26.039
at the real moment that I mean Trinity

4e52d1e3-58ec-4fb6-9ff7-0d1ec5a5ff6b
00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.698
was about to escape from the matrix.

NOTE Confidence: 0.641548852142857

702aea35-be82-49a5-a4fe-bb315d66634c
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.068
And, uh, the idea was that the only

bef614fe-0a38-4095-a682-d99b8a93e9e4
00:00:32.068 --> 00:00:35.792
way in or out of the matrix is just,

be48f1ac-32fe-44a4-85b6-366298001c7d
00:00:35.792 --> 00:00:38.564
uh, through the phone and it

NOTE Confidence: 0.641548852142857

8c6b5028-3696-42f3-b6a8-7bdb504dbb39
00:00:38.564 --> 00:00:40.800
is possible to do that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.641548852142857

2290a15b-6db1-452e-a9d7-26d634de3e1d
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.146
So why we put this slide here?

57576dc5-aa88-4f62-9b2f-9bc8a1d48756
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.852
Because you'll see that dealing with

b6bc1b9d-288f-4d4a-bdf6-b38470714300
00:00:47.852 --> 00:00:52.216
a file or a device is like dealing.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.245
I mean making a connection

9d1b4909-da0d-4b74-ad63-a9515eb0cdbf
00:00:54.245 --> 00:00:56.270

00:00:59.518 --> 00:01:02.987
the device or the file doesn't matter.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.594
Very similar to this movie that

f50c9ce0-bf60-41db-ac55-c99045598b93
00:01:05.594 --> 00:01:08.190

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.940
The connection matters the most.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:13.590
So.

366ce3a2-4667-4fee-8b8e-5c9b5e8e67c1
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.416
We said that oh, one thing again,

1283a5e7-1baf-4bbc-a067-401578655eb0
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.668
I tried to put this slide from what

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.744
So this is the old topics we are going

d8ea101b-1065-4c6c-b58e-32f4678dbbaa

chapter three and also we add some

d18df242-2a7b-4f3e-9a04-2c2ed1e63f6b

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.990
So this is the reference book, uh?

41e06a55-dd3c-4b13-ac06-9ad24ae7614e
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.080
If I borrow some other

f1bdbd42-2fe1-43da-935f-79a74d3d3606
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.072
topics from other books,

NOTE Confidence: 0.79538966

0a36c362-920c-414c-9677-2e1769d06904
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.076
I will post it in the slides as well.

NOTE Confidence: 0.79538966

8bf3f976-ab5f-4fd3-aaf6-d70c02e57acb
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.792
So we said that we start with gradually

NOTE Confidence: 0.79538966

4e7e865b-e4a8-46ba-8d6b-c7c8a5bf6a73
00:01:54.792 --> 00:01:57.667
go into the kernel of the operating

036e31f3-0d51-44e0-8e56-bc45c5d68d83
00:01:57.667 --> 00:02:00.230
system after covering the shell part.

NOTE Confidence: 0.79538966

34210131-f184-4a77-9b51-289e5c3c1b8a
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.174
The shell is not part of the kernel,

NOTE Confidence: 0.79538966

c00a875d-2da1-4137-ad62-eb851ff11eff
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.088
it's just a add in or.

NOTE Confidence: 0.79538966

6c192736-19b5-4e1b-a8a6-ac35dfa8a088
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.706
I mean kind of additional problem.

NOTE Confidence: 0.79538966

c01733dc-dcb7-4764-ba9a-f6f889871c27
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.000
An operating system delivered by **** I mean.

NOTE Confidence: 0.79538966

5a25aca3-5b96-44e9-8960-01a970760656
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.480
Next to the kernel.

NOTE Confidence: 0.79538966

9d499c3a-5f1e-4ed0-9893-4b53a0df1844
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.700
But now we gradually move toward

NOTE Confidence: 0.79538966

42fa8aec-d8ef-41ab-835f-98bfd967be18
00:02:14.771 --> 00:02:17.186
the kernel and the store with him.

1599a8f4-0a61-44b2-b15d-b32125c76814
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.045
Kind of simplest part of

246de538-2b29-4203-9939-4f26774239d7
00:02:19.045 --> 00:02:20.529
the kernel File Manager.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.863
So File Manager as you can see here has

134059ce-1d33-45bc-83ec-427d3c27b8d0
00:02:28.863 --> 00:02:32.970
three main different levels of abstraction

2f8cc9a4-5f07-41f4-9a10-dae1b71739a1
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.439
from the operating system point of view.

40768cf0-cbe7-49d8-af8c-3cd456837dee
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.176
A high level which is the level that all

5662b8f0-efca-4d7f-93e2-0d1775a9f621
00:02:40.176 --> 00:02:42.966
the other programmers are dealing with.

a31d95de-6b3c-4ec3-8907-cef011049e7b
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.145
And this I mean this beneath the high level

f22cb30e-285b-4e82-9166-4793f70536ab
00:02:50.145 --> 00:02:54.369
there is a low level handling of the devices

feb03624-f807-4e2f-af0a-9ff90aac21c7
00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:58.346
and the files by the operating system.

4b21ff52-a2f1-467b-8ee9-58e04abdb3dd
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.602
We touched some topics about that, but

47c55e0c-e34f-435b-a997-28c4ef7ffe9b
00:03:01.602 --> 00:03:04.500
this is not our main topic in this course.

74bedd10-9f63-46a4-8c92-4e94e300dfbf
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.307
Basically our main focus is the high

be05af00-b280-43c5-ba11-b4123ca7855b
00:03:07.307 --> 00:03:09.749
level abstraction of the files and

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:12.872
device by the operating system and the

00:03:12.872 --> 00:03:17.600
last layer of the File Manager is the.

2124e6b5-2bc0-4aab-9144-208e6a8db81c
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.100
Dealing directly with the device,

NOTE Confidence: 0.7091198372

ce7fe715-58ac-4903-b413-245689845fd0
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.852
we will not cover these this layer

ada7be9e-5021-4673-829a-a51b7a2bc267
00:03:23.852 --> 00:03:27.480
because it needs knowledge of device.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7091198372

371a0632-80e7-400c-a331-ea7bc2387c30
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.510
What type of device we're

8e289362-0f84-4eb3-9872-31ce998a674d

8a0bff7a-2ed2-4b7a-ade2-9d2e35558ba5
00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.540
So at this level, at the device level,

bcbbf003-fb99-4f9e-bea3-d7ed4e90ab17
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.020
it matters that you are dealing with the

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.704

Or other devices.

ee3ca088-6bbc-4595-9df4-23e883821cd0
00:03:41.102 --> 00:03:45.242
The more we go up to the upper

level distinctions becomes a.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.180
I mean, you can simply ignore the distinction

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.139
and the distinctions actually disappear.

2dd5bb91-421a-4406-b7ab-3bc556eeaf5e
00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.000
At high level, it doesn't matter.

ab93d958-bbf9-45c4-99fe-cb28f4534265
00:04:15.702 --> 00:04:18.389
are considered files and doesn't matter.

00:28:45.146 --> 00:28:48.054
how you can read a prototype of

00:28:48.054 --> 00:28:51.187
a system called and you have to

00:28:51.187 --> 00:28:53.547
pay attention to the details.

00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:55.890
So what this system called does

00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:58.557
is that the first one is that

00:28:58.557 --> 00:29:00.951
you have to be careful that you

00:29:01.035 --> 00:29:03.990

4cadba56-3154-4ae8-95a3-17d73da289a5
00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:08.166
So basically the create is in the file

a9ff1eaa-9988-4eca-a453-d27caaf8730b
00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:14.400
So we already showed the standard

1380934d-dac8-40fe-be23-38274fc5d481
00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:19.690
So as you can see here,

a4aa1ba4-c5f9-432e-bed5-dd89ab7d8e00
00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:23.320
this is the file control.

but the only thing is important is

b2d32179-20d9-4774-b207-deaa76bddcd1
