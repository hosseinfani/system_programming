Is the focal with independent nested?

00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:05.828

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:12.307
So I would say that the child

At this moment the parents send the

00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:34.770
So there is no child yet.

feebe631-4a37-4f9f-8e8e-2ac5d3eaeb86
00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:41.466
So then we have the child,

00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:44.879
then it returns zero to the child.

f1a6d78b-562b-455b-abe9-8054f835acd2
00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:50.955

We have a grandchild here.

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:08.062

cdc14ef7-445b-46dd-b5a6-36cc52a9be67
00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:17.806

a6d64fd3-49f0-4630-99a4-daac7f25ad51
00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:34.548
OK so I will continue a little.

00:32:58.612 --> 00:33:01.220
I mean you have to ask a lot of question

e39dd1ec-4d7a-4b4e-8702-4841002b2e27
00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:04.588

00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:08.978
So as you see, so far, uh?

NOTE Confidence: 0.74269933

55e26253-3157-4310-9b27-6aaabf3172a8
00:33:08.978 --> 00:33:12.962
This is a process that we can create

b27e2066-6d83-462d-9653-d5e12f9c965f
00:33:12.962 --> 00:33:16.885
a new process so we have a single

00:33:16.885 --> 00:33:19.865
process parent and then we give birth

39c5f1c3-1bfc-4b6d-b6c5-4a7363569ce3
00:33:19.865 --> 00:33:22.899
to a newborn process and this newborn

f136ec7b-cdfe-4741-b4a6-8deae7dc8ed0
00:33:22.899 --> 00:33:25.377
process can do another fork and

8b58355d-911a-43ef-9697-7b89478c8d2c
00:33:25.377 --> 00:33:28.207
give another grandchild and attach.

NOTE Confidence: 0.74269933

e1ffda92-6682-44d1-8281-9e2d9f373288
00:33:28.210 --> 00:33:30.500
So.

NOTE Confidence: 0.74269933

320948ff-4b2f-4eb0-8539-1cecdadf5d56
00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:34.410
This is the one of the naive or kind of

1c1e19c0-9dab-42c4-9131-55566d9b5bd9
00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:38.734
immediate pattern to create a new process,

NOTE Confidence: 0.74269933

fffea4fd-3173-483c-9634-44673e387065
00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:42.060
because it's a generative model.

NOTE Confidence: 0.74269933

aa5ea88c-4749-46b0-b7ab-7bfc729564d5
00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:45.686
So basically most of the programmers may

NOTE Confidence: 0.74269933

03b18ba4-2dd0-4a98-9aec-3ece7c663255
00:33:45.686 --> 00:33:49.398
follow this pattern of creating a new child.

NOTE Confidence: 0.74269933

12ad3ad2-13e3-4690-9c2b-42ccc76834d4
00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:52.706
Basically writing those if else clauses.

NOTE Confidence: 0.74269933

6ed39b79-be79-4352-a809-38a18f49c191
00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:55.740
So the idea is this.

NOTE Confidence: 0.74269933

6ccd4447-9b43-47e0-80b3-08ddaa71b98b
00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:57.604
Inside the pattern process,

NOTE Confidence: 0.74269933

28892bb9-34b0-4258-8121-e1092e92159f
00:33:57.604 --> 00:33:59.934
when we write a program.

NOTE Confidence: 0.74269933

293ed392-4ce6-43ba-98b6-d36c5b060eec
00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:02.064
We write the programs,

NOTE Confidence: 0.74269933

cc0d012f-b749-4b13-9273-80d566ef4812
00:34:02.064 --> 00:34:04.719
opcodes and statements not only

NOTE Confidence: 0.74269933

8ec36a36-76ad-4acf-8901-099ed611ec26
00:34:04.719 --> 00:34:07.727
for the parent process itself.

NOTE Confidence: 0.74269933

d6613b77-9ef9-43a4-a491-d8bac0b17c26
00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:10.264
Model so we write the opcodes that

NOTE Confidence: 0.74269933

868713a3-9971-41c2-8f3a-088aecb29b5e
00:34:10.264 --> 00:34:13.327
is going to be handled by the child.

NOTE Confidence: 0.74269933

8a44adca-db3e-495d-899b-1cf4faad9c45
00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:16.494
So the parent carries the task of

NOTE Confidence: 0.74269933

76a346ac-14e7-40ad-8eee-eb02e6206de0
00:34:16.494 --> 00:34:18.510
itself and the child.

NOTE Confidence: 0.74269933

e1992000-98b4-4651-b330-5b78752dc9da
00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:18.932
However,

NOTE Confidence: 0.74269933

e9368497-31b5-4513-8507-e769b4737c7f
00:34:18.932 --> 00:34:22.308
at runtime this is at the compile time,

210cd6fa-70ce-463e-a375-e79d227bedc5
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:24.210
so at compile time the

b48c172c-deb2-46e1-8a39-8456cbb9d22f
00:34:24.210 --> 00:34:26.110
parent has all the opcodes,

80d38f7a-0921-4eda-a855-55bff1fc7d73
00:34:26.110 --> 00:34:29.629
whether it is for itself or for the child.

NOTE Confidence: 0.74269933

c2fd490e-e1d1-4f9d-9952-f93c218ae5de
00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:33.806
At one time the parent does the 4th

NOTE Confidence: 0.74269933

9104993f-e3c7-43e9-b082-aef40636b056
00:34:33.810 --> 00:34:36.904
and then by those if else clauses

NOTE Confidence: 0.74269933

cfb644e7-c355-40f1-85bf-348c8e995ea3
00:34:36.904 --> 00:34:39.918
passes the child task to the child.

NOTE Confidence: 0.777202074

2b778804-6410-479e-a6cc-aff8de1c1fca
00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:44.440
So let's see the model.

a3231b63-4054-45c1-b5c6-02a926850bb3
00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:46.708
I mean very similar code that we've

a451829d-4206-469b-97b3-56f62bdf37da
00:34:46.708 --> 00:34:49.424
seen so far, but this is this.

NOTE Confidence: 0.777202074

02f06776-a3bd-4eb0-a85c-1a10ecc19392
00:34:49.424 --> 00:34:52.040
On the I mean abstract model.

3241275e-7cf5-4b7b-8886-516b96cdee06
00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:55.592
So here is the pattern of most of

NOTE Confidence: 0.777202074

36c02b45-be5d-4cba-95e4-ec87ec86ec5a
00:34:55.592 --> 00:34:59.009
the programs that wants to do a task

3a693fd4-c867-48e4-b712-66f2954d9d6b
00:34:59.009 --> 00:35:02.180
by a child process or creating A4.

78287b96-d473-47a5-b4a7-6c43039c32f7
00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:04.292
So for instance, we have a lot of

NOTE Confidence: 0.777202074

004a908f-9b8b-4057-8c73-bac43ef132e9
00:35:04.292 --> 00:35:05.827
opcode before the four, whatever.

d128c59e-a52d-4f18-8bde-1cd1a8ee152e
00:35:05.827 --> 00:35:09.494
They're all just by the parent and at

049c7116-b884-4626-8eab-94fa0a9490cc
00:35:09.494 --> 00:35:13.148
some point the parent does the fork.

610b9be4-bb7b-4d0f-8115-dfe283bf7950
00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:15.530
The parent based on this value should

0ed63ebb-ca51-4b08-8661-265a16a91ec2
00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:17.662
check first at whether the creation

ab0830bc-b8d6-40ca-b2c2-22b4cc205dc7

the creation of the child was

ff68dd7b-598d-4d46-acab-2f88749bab81
00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:45.090
If you cannot have a child

ac97851f-ef2b-4b7c-9261-ba8b2ad67c6c

806c7121-5f41-4c91-ba27-ae69edf404ff

you have to do that, ask yourself.

00:35:48.774 --> 00:35:52.438
So you have to do those tasks that you

Now you have to do it yourself because

there is no chance to have a child.

these two as a parent and child

f2a13067-96fc-4df2-ba5d-cd0d7d2dba01
00:43:50.411 --> 00:43:53.230
the same way I did in this slide,

2c9effe0-e98b-4234-a29b-745859e547b6
00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:55.300
you'll see that it's still

00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:57.370
you're gonna have orphan child.

df940d32-de86-4100-a672-bc33c3f05862
00:43:57.370 --> 00:43:58.099
It's very simple.

55180bb7-07ed-467e-9504-43041dcae1b4
00:43:58.099 --> 00:44:00.180
If you give higher priority to the parent,

NOTE Confidence: 0.76753237

7dec726d-79f6-445a-b3f9-3e18c02738fc
00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:01.530

a2cf3bf7-5285-47fe-a442-34b8bd068a2b

Does this check in this is

00:44:03.156 --> 00:44:04.610
true and then goes here.

e058715d-20a3-49b4-a8e2-cc60ae3de8ab

00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:10.536
So the parent is gone and now the

00:44:12.378 --> 00:44:14.574
then this does this check in?

dde0d9fc-da76-4d0e-b529-61de88264bf2
00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:16.855
Does it checking this is false comes

f296612b-539a-4774-88cd-56b9fc770ea4
00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:23.701
So at some point you have a orphan child

94982f41-f22c-446a-99a1-bf1d2ee4f17e
00:44:23.701 --> 00:44:27.845
that exists after the exit of the parent.

00:44:27.850 --> 00:44:32.152
So this is the idea proposed by Mesa exactly.

NOTE Confidence: 0.76753237

cca3c2ee-cc03-441e-b165-18376c90343b
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:33.918
So we can.

dae8bc21-d98a-46bd-bf82-b022a9413e51
00:44:33.918 --> 00:44:37.434
Do we can avoid the parents?

4d3979a7-9e2a-4232-b1de-e4dca6c2a6ea

00:44:39.212 --> 00:44:42.815
So although we have some tasks to the

a2ed26a1-2338-468d-ab18-ae1beb03ca49
00:44:42.815 --> 00:44:45.383
pattern for the parent to execute,

00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:48.502
we say that after your task is done

00:44:48.502 --> 00:44:51.788
as a parent, do not simply exist.

take the responsibility for your

child and then if your child is

00:44:57.290 --> 00:44:59.922
done then you are allowed to exist.

fbcc0c27-4b71-4e99-aa1b-043953fdc7e4
00:44:59.930 --> 00:45:02.486
So again, this is a pattern.

d899ec7d-92de-4440-be9c-3ff96714658f
00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:16.776

b4a9466d-940a-4869-bca3-d43cfb38af50
