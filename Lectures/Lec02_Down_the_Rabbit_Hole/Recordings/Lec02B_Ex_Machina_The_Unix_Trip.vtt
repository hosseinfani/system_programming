00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.340
because kernel cannot do that,

so kernel doesn't have the processor,

Because of the IRQ electrical signal,

0dd1e1f2-8b1e-4b3f-82cd-166edf3aef23
00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:41.278
So usually we do system call.

or RQ handlers because as we said,

you most likely work with the IRQ calls.

01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:09.265
So basically, Unix was an operating system.
