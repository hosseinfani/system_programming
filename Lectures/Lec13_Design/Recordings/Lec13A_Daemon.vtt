00:25:40.184 --> 00:25:42.469
you may go for the first design

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:47.620

you kind of touched on this idea

really elegant or complex solution

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:22.370
that maybe it's the best solution,

35e30873-c54d-4633-9bf5-8f06aa2dc591
00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:23.833
but it can create this sort of

ea1e945f-155d-4434-aff6-eec630d015aa
00:26:25.365 --> 00:26:26.785
more difficult for the company,

3cc4a390-38c9-4ce3-9db1-42893fd3666e
00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:28.430
because not every programmer

00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:31.876
and it's sort of above the skill

ef2e19a3-3f62-454d-9649-2d3df09bad56
00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:36.650

d3a8c8ee-7207-4dcb-bb60-287b3142da58
00:27:08.175 --> 00:27:11.700
So it is asynchronous like

00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:19.150
We create a file.

00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:21.850
It's not just having one child.

00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:25.290
 We create N children.

00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:29.106
And then we divide or split the array

NOTE Confidence: 0.930047245

916835d8-1a19-49b9-a309-5f4c544a0304
00:27:29.106 --> 00:27:32.724
into end different subparts and then

7f911f8d-3e10-4adb-bc71-47f3a6b987c9
00:27:32.724 --> 00:27:35.500
we give each part to each child to

dff4cec9-1462-490a-871e-30d07de4746e
00:27:35.587 --> 00:27:38.739
write that a specific part of the file.

13f95c11-ed3e-4c4b-83cb-f2a6e4dfacd7
00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:41.410
So each child gonna write that

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:50.140
So. What are the pros?

48134fef-142b-43b6-9a0f-9fb2e85d6579
00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:53.428
The pros is that your program.

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:55.500

This way we each process has its own socket.

You remember we in the example

00:41:41.890 --> 00:41:44.464
And we ask you to write a code to

ef22f9a6-7ebb-4d00-a274-33ca42d7ffb1
00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:52.352
So basically, uh,

793bd533-8bf7-4c02-917a-67cae9ecbf06
00:41:52.352 --> 00:41:54.656
you first have to know what

For instance the sizes M and then you

For instance, uh.

Make a point of data,

9520157c-2f8d-410d-8dde-a2bfc1cac912
00:42:16.290 --> 00:42:19.186
so then you have to do some calculation

f5707d40-b242-4b4e-8097-b3db24d51598
00:42:19.186 --> 00:42:22.327
in order to see how many child you need.

00:42:22.330 --> 00:42:25.840
And in a four loop you create these children.

a29d8bbb-df43-4434-8bcc-b88c5da42789
00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:28.290

creating the children, it's about

00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:42.323
So you have to first of all, uh,

d04fdbba-9f92-4afd-9b88-44ebb272061b
00:42:42.323 --> 00:42:46.121
you have to have multiple file

In order to write to the file.

fb09911c-7d77-4189-807e-b6434fb46b06
00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:57.348
Another thing is that you have to allow

So here is the design.

We bootstrapped the process

However, we had some processes that never
