efficient and pretty program. Bikol,

04bb8ade-1ff3-4afb-93b0-1181e71b192e
00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:21.900
we introduced the idea of design patterns.

And as an example,

70af1a3c-5ce3-4eb8-bbba-48f01d20477d
00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:26.200
we introduce a daemon process which

84cd22de-49ca-4032-b2eb-6e885c7ee3bc
00:28:26.282 --> 00:28:29.145
basically we want to have a process.

And it stays in the memory forever.

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:41.705
We put an example for this server.

00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:45.940
We tried to make it a as a daemon process.

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:49.279
The process of making a process as a demon.

df32ba01-bca3-4c91-9ff0-4933c74df3d4
00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:52.080
It's called demonising, a process.

We use this pattern to demonize our server.

There are different ways of demonising,

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:12.985
