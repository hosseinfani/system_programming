00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:42.540

that's why we receive an error when

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:52.992

37f12072-cef5-4820-bc26-81e716c9f483
00:29:52.992 --> 00:29:55.032
if there is no connection,

00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:07.567
So now we have to first fix this problem.

b550cbe0-671a-4bf5-b80f-80fe02bebb81
00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:10.626
We have to write a server process

00:30:10.626 --> 00:30:15.230
and then run it on a computer and

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:17.355
then make a connection between

00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:27.410

4d551ea5-ac0b-4246-8444-dc20facb12e1
00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:29.978
We try to write a program for the

then are the client can start communicating.

4dcd624d-db4a-4cea-b9ad-10ec09da879c
00:30:40.330 --> 00:30:45.167
So. Let's see what are the tasks that,

00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:49.265
as a programmer, we have to write in our

00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:58.467
These steps, as you can see here,

dd84fbc7-7dd0-4928-8cd2-a5dec419e0ca
00:30:58.470 --> 00:31:01.620
is very similar to the UDP.

f26b407d-4c81-4a66-9237-2e66d1f1481a
00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:04.932
As long as you have to create a socket.

d9211e21-9e5c-488c-9bf8-91190cb419d8
00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:08.180
You have to bind the address to the socket,

daa373f0-6e37-40d1-9568-aeb5418dede6
00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:11.566
so because this is the part of

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:18.888
you have to bind an address.

NOTE Confidence: 0.5682076

931e329f-0a8a-4986-9522-877b27f98a85
00:31:18.890 --> 00:31:21.626
So this is a mandatory part.

de58576b-780f-4602-9125-3422b6f045e4
00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:25.320
Because on a knowing this address

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:27.558
the clients can connect to you.

00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:32.570
But fun, this is stab.

caea0f31-1921-4896-8cf1-0dfdd2d35d95
00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:42.750
So in TCP you have to tell the kernel that.

2a7b4708-cbc1-4d1d-9f41-5d4eec4dfa3c
00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:47.446

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:54.590
After that you wait for a call from

8e4f5bb4-5611-4833-adc9-692db71ab536
00:31:56.840 --> 00:32:00.641
you pick up or accept the clients

And you check the clients address.

05ec5fc5-4889-4f46-81d2-b13b290a989b
00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:08.500
If the client address is the one

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:12.020
that you want to do a communication,

00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:15.177
then you accept the call and after

9bd88823-fedd-4106-937f-4c31fa3cbe61
00:32:15.177 --> 00:32:17.910
that you start communicating.

00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:19.590
So these steps,

df1b6f00-9aed-477a-bb45-0488e8b45742
00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:22.950
these three steps are the difference.

6f8421d6-cdce-4fcf-99df-1a58fbcb0954
00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:25.827

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:33.522
So in the TCP the server should

00:32:33.522 --> 00:32:35.829

00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:42.890
And then start communicating with the client

f67f5900-f6d1-4aea-a072-53fdf85fe4c0
00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:46.740
