00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:52.791
So the message is going to be

00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:04.460

00:42:09.344 --> 00:42:14.433
You always wait for receiving a message.

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:18.647

d09b31f1-1a88-4e71-a404-5a013124eab4
00:42:29.010 --> 00:42:31.042

2bfe6bf8-5837-46dc-924b-fb2a0a97abe7
00:42:39.245 --> 00:42:41.860
then when it's done with this message

00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:44.359
it goes to receive a new message.

00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:47.552
So it goes to waiting state again so

aba6ec7f-1719-4215-97ad-2f727bc15fd7
00:42:47.552 --> 00:42:53.627
you do a a forever loop and in this

00:42:53.627 --> 00:42:56.420

accf72d3-cb3b-4ce8-b349-bb756b41626e
00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:01.336

f3ec35f4-cb83-40f3-920f-18be8b25c5ff
00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:05.020

00:43:05.435 --> 00:43:08.755
what would be a better way to avoid

8ff7d78a-6f81-410a-b105-ebde9da7dd8e
00:43:28.178 --> 00:43:30.884

so the receiver receives the messages,

00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:43.492
You create a new child and you ask the

a4b56da8-32dc-422f-9884-7baa68decd12
00:44:53.506 --> 00:44:55.262
you analyze the message again.

00:45:04.599 --> 00:45:09.460
The best way here is that you do a fork.

d1d3bbf1-4f7b-4e39-ab63-853b1edd3079
00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:12.660
And you give the task of waiting and

So this is the best pattern you

23fdf80f-6af8-4c36-ab9e-932e3fb656bd
00:45:22.806 --> 00:45:25.658

01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:41.104
There are multiple senders,

01:00:44.355 --> 01:00:46.830
The receiver should tell the

41a53013-ee0a-4c53-89ad-11cff6087ecc
01:00:49.690 --> 01:00:52.630
so that's why the receiver should

definitely define the IP and the port,

because this reservoir should make it public.

use the receiver public address to

01:01:32.334 --> 01:01:34.710

it is hard coded inside the program.

Then your program as a receiver or
